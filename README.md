Balkon's WeaponMod, a Minecraft mod about weapons.  
This is [HyperSpeeed](https://nmexis.me/)'s modernisation fork.

## Why?

Rest in Pieces, Balkon's WeaponMod!  
This project is meant as a homage to our good old friend: Balkon's WeaponMod.  
Ten years ago (at the time of writing this it is mid-2024), the mod was abandoned.  
There were a few attempts to revive it, some of which were unofficial (mostly direct ports), some were rewrites such
as [Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reforged).  
As one of the two creators of Reforged, I wanted to pose a challenge to myself:  
Directly port this gem of a mod to modern versions of Minecraft.

It is currently the 8th June 2024, and I started this whole endeavour on the 17th February 2024.  
Yes, it took a bit more than 4 months to finish this port.  
I am working full-time, so I can only dedicate a bit of my precious time to projects like this.  
I hope you enjoy playing around with it!

Without anything further to say, enjoy!
